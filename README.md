# Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users explore and understand essential algorithms through visualization. The tool provides an intuitive interface to observe how algorithms work step-by-step.

üöÄ **Live Demo**: [Visit the Algorithm Visualizer](https://chalimba-algo-visualizer.netlify.app/)

## Technologies

This application leverages modern web development technologies and libraries:

- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: As the core framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **React Icons**: For an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms üü¶‚û°Ô∏è

Visualize sorting algorithms with dynamic bar animations:

1. **Generate Bars**: Click **NEW** to create a randomized set of bars.
2. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose from:
   - **Merge Sort**
   - **Insertion Sort**
   - **Quick Sort**
   - **Heap Sort**
3. **Customize Settings**: Use sliders to adjust:
   - The number of bars
   - Animation delay
4. **Start Sorting**: Hit **START** to begin the visualization.

### Pathfinding Algorithms üü¶‚û°Ô∏èüü•

Find the shortest path between two nodes on a grid:

1. **Grid Setup**:
   - Use **Clear** to reset the grid and **Maze** to generate a maze.
   - Walls are represented by blocked grid cells.
2. **Select an Algorithm**:
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - **A\* Search**
3. **Interactive Editing**:
   - Use the **Pen-Button** to draw walls and the **Erase-Button** to remove them.
   - Drag the start node (purple) or end node (red) using the **Move-Button**.
4. **Run the Algorithm**: Adjust rows, columns, and animation speed using sliders, then click **START**.
5. **Real-Time Updates**: Moving the start or end node after execution recalculates the path dynamically.

### Tree Traversal üå≤‚û°Ô∏è

Explore binary tree traversals through animations:

1. **Select a Traversal Algorithm**:
   - **Inorder Traversal**
   - **Preorder Traversal**
   - **Postorder Traversal**
   - **Level Order Traversal**
2. **Customize Settings**:
   - Adjust the number of nodes in the tree.
   - Set the animation delay.
3. **Run the Traversal**: Click **START** to begin the animation.
