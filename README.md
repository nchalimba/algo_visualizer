## Technologies

The following libraries were used while implementing the app:

- React
- Next.js
- React Icons
  <br>
  <br>

## Features

This project includes the following features:

### Sorting

In this page, you can sort a set of bars. To use this feature:

1. Click **NEW** to create a random set of bars
2. Choose one of the following algorithms: **Merge Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**
3. Use the sliders to specify the amount of bars and the delay between animation steps
4. Click **START**

   <br>

### Pathfinding

This page enables the calculation of the shortest path between a start node (green) and an end node (red) within a grid. To use this feature:

1. Click **Clear** to remove all walls and **Random** to create walls at random positions
2. Choose one of the following algorithms: **Breadth-First Search**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, **A\* Search**
3. Use the sliders to specify the amount of rows and columns, as well as the delay between animation steps
4. Click the **Pen-Button** and the **Erase-Button** to paint or remove walls
5. Click the **Move-Button** to move the start or end node
6. Click **START**

If you move the start or end node after running the algorithm, the new shortest path is calculated in real-time.

### Tree Traversal

This page animates the traversal of a complete binary tree. To use this feature:

1. Choose one of the following algorithms: **Inorder Traversal**, **Postorder Traversal**, **Preorder Traversal**, **Level Order Traversal**
2. Use the sliders to specify the amount of nodes and the delay between animation steps
3. Click **START**
